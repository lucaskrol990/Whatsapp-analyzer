Version where the chat statistics are aggregated. Also contains some additional statistics

Run file Dashboard_aggregated.py

Put figures in assets:
Person_1.jpg (You)
Person_2.jpg (Lover)
Cute_photo.png (Photo of lover and you, advise transparant backgroud)

Put chat in chats:
Change Dashboard_aggregated.py such that it knows your filename (see first line after imports)

Good luck!
